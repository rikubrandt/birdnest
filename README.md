# PROJECT BIRDNEST

Reaktor pre-assignment

API service that tracks the violations from the Reaktor API can be found [here](https://github.com/rikubrandt/birdback).

The API service goes to sleep after no user has connected to the API for 10 minutes.

App is live [here](https://birdnest-nine.vercel.app/)

# Critique

- Solution is more hacking together a script than a production ready application.
- Data is lost after no user has connected to the deployed application in a while.
- UI is as basic as it can get.
